= Kogito-Wiki-Maven

An example project that demonstrates how to process Kogito-wiki in a Maven site using the Asciidoctor Maven plugin.

== Usage

Build the site by invoking the `site:site` goal:

 $ mvn site:site

Open the file _target/site/index.html_ to see the output generated for the entire site including the links to the all documents.

**_NOTE:_**  Though the site renders properly, I'm currently getting this error on the terminal when I run the above command: `Execution default-cli of goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-site-plugin:3.7.1:site failed.: NullPointerException`. Let me know if this happens in your system as well. Any help in this regard is highly appreciated :smile:
